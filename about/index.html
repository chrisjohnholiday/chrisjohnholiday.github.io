        		<h1>About</h1>
				<p>The collection, management and analysis of large amounts of data has empirical
        applications in raising human welfare. It is my passion to learn and demonstrate how
        statistical modelling and machine learning can help predict health outcomes at a micro
        and macro level. As a student of economics and statistics I use applied econometric
        analysis in addition to machine learning to answer what I believe are relevant and
        important problems in the field of public health.</p>
