    "<span style=\"font-size:0.75em;\"> *This notebook is based off of a project which was done with Stephen Ayeni under the supervision of Professor Eduardo Souza Rodrigues for a fourth year undergraduate class in applied Econometrics. We were tasked with answering what we believed to be an important economic question of our choosing and use empirical techniques on publically available data to attempt to answer it. As my part of the project I gathered, cleaned and performed analysis on the data along with Stephen Ayeni who helped ensure quality writing quality and making our project ready for submission. Professor Souza-Rodrigues outlined for us the standard of statistical analysis and reporting necessary to ensure the project was approaching the quality of an academic publication. Many thanks to Amanda Mckinley who inspired and gave the economic basis for the project and to Joseph Gorga who provided continous support, advice and guidance thoroughout.* </span>\n"

We cannot reject the null hypothesis that contraceptive prevelance has an effect on Maternal Mortality ratio, therefore there is no evidence of such an effect. We can see that in this model, the fraction of variance due to fixed effects is very high (rho value of 0.81024977). This shows that had we not controlled for unobserved hetereogeneity that we would have asserted a causal relationship when there in fact was not any.

Many of these solutions required a complex approach that took into account the existing health infrastructure, it's quality and importantly the information which mothers and families had available to them.
